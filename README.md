# Stock Management ( Project at master branch of this repo )

A stock management application I created for KrushiArk Naturals was later sold as an independent stock management software. It is a web application based on Django framework in Python. The features of this project are listed below :
1) Provides an admin user interface to execute all CRUD operations on all models registered on admin site. Every operation done by Admin is also tracked.

2) Provides an intuitive user interface for a user to manage his stock management requirements namely:
      1)**Adding New Product**
      2) Showing previous Purchases/Sales of a particular product
      3) Edit Product
      4) Deleting Product
      5)**Adding New Supplier**
      6) Showing previous Purchases/Sales by a particular Supplier
      7) Edit Supplier
      8) Deleting Product
      9)**Adding New Customer**
      10) Showing previous Purchases/Sales by a particular Customer
      11) Edit Customer
      12) Deleting Product
      13)**Adding a Sales Invoice** 
      14) Printing a Sales Invoice
      15) Edit a Sales Invoice
      16) Deleting a Sales Invoice
      17)**Adding a Purchase Invoice**
      18) Printing a Purchase Invoice
      19) Edit a Purchase Invoice
      20)  Deleting a Purchase Invoice

 3) Doesn't allow the user to delete Customers/Suppliers if the customer/supplier is linked to any invoice. Shows an error and procedure to follow to obtain this.

 4) Tracks Reorder Levels and throws errors on product stock reaching its reorder level.

 5) Provides Data Analytics for Inventory Preparation and Trend Identification.
